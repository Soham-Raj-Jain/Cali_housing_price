# Cali_housing_price

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house sale prices in California using data from the Kaggle competition “California House Prices.”
The goal is to build a supervised regression model that accurately estimates property prices based on a variety of real estate features.

By analyzing patterns between house characteristics (like number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and lot size) and their actual selling prices, the project aims to develop a reliable predictive system that can generalize to unseen listings.

🎯 Objective

Input: Property features (e.g., square footage, location, number of rooms, year built, etc.)

Output: Predicted “Sold Price” for each property

Task Type: Supervised machine learning — regression problem

🧠 Theoretical Foundation
1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data — where each example includes both input features and the correct output (the house’s sold price).
The model learns a mapping function:

𝑓
(
𝑋
)
≈
𝑦
f(X)≈y

where:

𝑋
X: feature set (e.g., area, rooms, location)

𝑦
y: target variable (sold price)

After training, the model predicts 
𝑦
^
y
^
	​

 for new, unseen properties.

2. Regression Techniques

Several regression algorithms can be explored:

Model	Description
Linear Regression	Simple, interpretable baseline assuming linear relationships.
Ridge / Lasso Regression	Adds regularization to prevent overfitting.
Decision Tree Regressor	Non-linear model splitting data hierarchically by feature values.
Random Forest / Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)	Ensemble models that combine many decision trees for higher accuracy and robustness.
Neural Networks	Capture complex non-linear patterns, useful with large, rich datasets.
3. Feature Engineering

Improving model performance by transforming and enriching input features:

Handling missing values and outliers

Encoding categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding)

Creating interaction or polynomial features

Scaling/normalizing numerical data

Geospatial feature extraction (e.g., latitude-longitude effects on price)

4. Model Evaluation

Since this is a regression problem, we use error-based metrics to measure performance:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

R² (Coefficient of Determination)

The model with the lowest validation error and stable performance across folds is typically selected for submission.
